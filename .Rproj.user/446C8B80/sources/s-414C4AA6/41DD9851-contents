# Overview

The goal of this workshop is to teach you how to efficiently manage and share 
your code. Code is a living, ever-changing thing, and using it efficiently 
requires a system able to accommodate changes implemented through time and by 
multiple users while guaranteeing long-term integrity. Version control is a 
powerful tool to help us achieve efficient code management, and more broadly,
reproducible research. Here, we will focus on Git and GitHub as our software of
choice. At the end of these two days, you will be able to: 

1. Optimize your directory organization;
2. Create Git repositories for each of your research projects;
3. Automatically keep track of changes you make in your code;
4. Synchronize changes between collaborators on a project;
5. Retrieve previous versions of code when necessary.

The content is organized in two Chapters, articulated over two days:

* Chapter \@ref(version-control-git), Version Control with Git
* Chapter \@ref(git-hub), Collaborative Science with GitHub

## Software Requirements and Installation Instructions

### Git

Git is a distributed version control system. It is free and open source. To
install Git, follow instructions for your operating system below. 

#### Windows

Download from the Git website: go to https://git-scm.com/download/win and the 
download will start automatically.

#### Mac OS

On Mavericks (10.9) or above, when you try to run a Git command from the 
Terminal for the first time, the installation will start automatically if you 
don't already have Git installed. Type the following in the terminal:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}

$ git --version

```

And follow the instructions on the installation wizard. 

#### Linux

In the command line:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}

$ sudo apt install git-all

```

### GitHub

We are going to use GitHub through the web browser, so no need to install any 
additional software. Just make sure you create a GitHub account on https://github.com/.
