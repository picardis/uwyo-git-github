<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 2</span> Version Control with Git</h1>
<p>Git is a version control system. It tracks all the changes you make to your files and allows you to go back to previous versions as far back in time as you need, like a time machine. Git is useful for a variety of reasons. Most of us are familiar with folders that look like this:</p>
<div style="text-align:center" markdown="1">
<div class="figure">
<img src="img/version-nightmare.png" style="width:50.0%" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Messy folder</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Saving multiple versions of files like this is problematic because, first, it uses space inefficiently (even if files are small, multiple versions add up and end up wasting a lot of room on our computers); second, and perhaps most importantly, it creates confusion and makes our workflow prone to errors. Instead of manually saving edits to a file in a separate copy “just in case”, and instead of having to keep track of which is the most recent version, we can put our files under version control and let Git keep track of the changes we make. Git will record a history of changes to each file without duplicating it, and we’ll be able to revert to any previous version in the history of that file. Version control allows us to be clean and tidy in our file organization, optimizing use of space without ever fearing to lose any of our work. Once a file is tracked by Git, it is virtually impossible to do anything irreversible to it.</p>
<p>I haven’t mentioned anything yet about the benefits of version control for collaborative work. This is because at its core, Git works locally on your computer. We often tend to think of version control as the way to handle multiple users working on the same file simultaneously, but Git is first and foremost a tool for your own file organization. Git is installed and runs on your machine, not on a network. It is the integration with an external server, be it private or public (GitHub and GitLab, for example, are public server providers), that makes Git a tool for multiple-user applications. This chapter focuses on the local functionalities of Git, while we’ll dive into its benefits for collaborative projects in the next Chapter.</p>
<div id="directory-organization" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Directory organization</h2>
<p>Git works on a project-by-project basis. Each project you work on with Git will become its own <strong>Git repository</strong>. A repository is nothing but a folder with Git functionalities enabled on it. Because everything in Git revolves around repositories as functional units, deciding how to split our files into folders will make the difference between a smooth, streamlined workflow and a clunky, inefficient one. So, to make the most of Git, we need to take a step back and take a look at how files are organized on our computer.</p>
<p>Your file browser, or file explorer, shows your directory tree (directory is a synonym for folder). The base of the tree is what we call the root directory (this is usually <code>C:/</code> in Windows and <code>/</code> on Mac/Linux). Nested folders and subfolders branch out from the root and define our directory structure. There are infinite possible directory structures that we can choose to organize our files. For example, say that we are working on a research project that entails data cleaning, analysis, and writing of a manuscript. One way to go about it is to have a project directory that contains subfolders for data, analysis code, results, and the manuscript file/s. We can call this a “project-based directory layout.”</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:proj-based"></span>
<img src="img/project-based-directory-organization.jpg" alt="Project-based directory organization" width="50%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 2.1: Project-based directory organization
</p>
</div>
<p>Alternatively, if we have multiple projects underway, we can split our files by activity rather than by projects and have a “data” folder, an “analyses” folder, a “manuscripts” folder, etc., all with a subfolder for each project. We can call this an “activity-based directory layout.”</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:act-based"></span>
<img src="img/activity-based-directory-organization.jpg" alt="Activity-based directory organization" width="50%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 2.2: Activity-based directory organization
</p>
</div>
<p>How you define a project is largely up to you. It could be all the work you do on a given dataset, or all the work you do for a thesis or dissertation, or each manuscript could be its own project even if it uses the same dataset as a different project. With so many options, how do we choose? Here are some key criteria to keep in mind:</p>
<div id="overlap" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> Overlap</h3>
<p>The first thing to consider is the overlap in data and code files between a project and other past/current projects. If two projects don’t share any data, it’s probably best to manage them separately. If two projects share a large amount of data, it might make more sense to manage them together as one. If you are writing functions to use across several different projects, they should probably be in their own project.</p>
</div>
<div id="minimizing-duplication" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.2</span> Minimizing duplication</h3>
<p>The reason why it’s important to account for overlap is because you want to minimize duplication as much as you can. Duplication of both data and code files is dangerous because it’s easy to lose track of modifications you have made to a file saved in one place but not in the other place. As you keep making changes, the two files will have the same name but different content, which generates confusion. Duplication is also inefficient because it occupies precious space on your computer.</p>
</div>
<div id="self-containedness" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.3</span> Self-containedness</h3>
<p>A fundamental quality of reproducible projects is that they are self-contained, meaning that ideally you could zip up the entire project directory and send it to a friend and they should be able to run your code and reproduce your results without changing anything. This means everything the project needs to work, from A to Z – data, functions, code – is contained in its root directory.</p>
</div>
<div id="tradeoffs" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.4</span> Tradeoffs</h3>
<p>The self-containedness criterion is sometimes in contradiction with minimizing duplication: if two projects share one or more data files, you can either violate the duplication criterion by making sure each project contains all the necessary data for the sake of self-containedness; or you can choose to sacrifice self-containedness to avoid file duplication and save space on your computer. The answer will depend on whether you anticipate the project to be widely shared or mostly for your personal use, how large the shared data files are, etc.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that there is no one-size-fits-all solution for project organization. Most importantly, the structure you choose needs to be functional for your needs. Putting thought into it is a great place to start.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="golden-rules-for-file-organization" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Golden rules for file organization</h2>
<p>Whichever directory structure you choose for a project, there are some universal rules to keep in mind for how to organize files within it.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>First and foremost, <strong>raw data should never be changed</strong>. Save it into a “data” folder and treat it as immutable. You can even set it as read-only to make sure there is no room for accidents.</p></li>
<li><p>The processed, clean version of your data will go into a dedicated “processed_data” folder.</p></li>
<li><p>Anything that can be generated from code goes into its own folder. This includes basically everything but the raw data and the code itself. You can have an “output” folder, or separate folders for output files and figures (e.g., “output” and “figures”)</p></li>
<li><p>If there are text documents, put them in their own folder (e.g., “docs”)</p></li>
<li><p>Code also has its own folder. If you write a lot of functions, it can be helpful to have a “funs” folder to store those and a “src” (for ‘source’) folder to save processing/analysis code.</p></li>
<li><p>If processing/analysis scripts are meant to be used in a certain order, you can number them (more on this in a minute). Sometimes the pipeline is not linear but branched, so numbering may not always make sense. Function scripts should not be numbered.</p></li>
<li><p>Modularize your code: instead of having a giant script to run your entire analysis from data cleaning to final figures, break up your workflow into several short, single-purpose scripts with well-defined inputs and outputs.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="relative-and-absolute-paths" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Relative and absolute paths</h2>
<p>To efficiently use Git, it is important to feel comfortable navigating our computer using paths. Paths define the location of files within the file system. There are two ways to point to a file from within a command prompt. The first is to use what is called an absolute path: this describes the full sequence of folders a file is contained in, starting from the root directory of a computer. When you right click on any file on your computer, you can look up its absolute path in the Properties. This is an example of an absolute path:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>C:/Users/MJS/Documents/PhD/Planning/schedule_2021.csv</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Relative paths describe the position of a file with respect to a reference directory. The reference directory is called a “working directory”. A relative path only shows the way from the working directory to the file of interest, while the part that goes from the root to the reference directory is left implicit. Appending a relative file path to the path of the working directory gives us the full absolute path to that file. For example, if our working directory was “Documents”, this would be the relative path to reach the same file as above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PhD/Planning/schedule_2021.csv</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If our working directory was “Planning”, this would be the relative path to the same file:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>schedule_2021.csv</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To work across subfolders of our working directory, we can just use relative paths to navigate and locate files. But relative paths also work to navigate across folders that are outside of the working directory, if need be. Using “../” in front of a folder name navigates to the parent of that folder (“parent” means the folder where that is contained). Let’s consider the following directory structure:</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:dir-example"></span>
<img src="img/directory-tree.png" alt="Example directory structure" width="1152" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 2.3: Example directory structure
</p>
</div>
<p>We can navigate to a file into “PhD/Research” from “Planning” like so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>../Research/GreenFrogs/data-cleaning.RProj</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The “../” means “the parent directory of the working directory”, which is “PhD”. We can also stack these to navigate further up the directory tree:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>../../../../DAJ</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The path above navigates all the way up to “Users” and into a different user’s directory.</p>
<div id="path-separators" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1</span> Path separators</h3>
<p>Something to be mindful of is that the separator between folder names in a path is different on different operating systems. On Windows, it is a backslash (“\”), while on Mac/Linux, it is a slash (“/”).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="command-line-basics" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Command line basics</h2>
<p>We are going to use Git from the command line in the computer’s terminal. The command line can be intimidating if you haven’t used it before, but using Git only requires basic familiarity with it. Commands are slightly different between operating systems, so I’ll assume Windows is the most commonly used and specify the Mac/Linux alternative when applicable.</p>
<p>When you open up the terminal (or command prompt) on your computer, you’ll see a symbol, on many computers it is a “$” or “&gt;”, followed by a blinking cursor. That symbol is called the prompt, and it means the terminal is waiting for your input. If you copy-paste any code from this chapter into your terminal,
<strong>make sure you only copy the part after the prompt</strong> (don’t copy the &gt;).
Also, if Ctrl+V does not work in the terminal, you can right-click to paste.</p>
<p>When you open the terminal, you should automatically be located in the root directory of your file system (or your home directory, if you have a computer with multiple users). The name of the folder you’re in appears right before the prompt. For example, this is what my prompt looks like:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="version-control-git.html#cb3-1"></a><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="ex">C</span>:\Users\Simona<span class="op">&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you are not in your root directory when you first open up the terminal, you can use the following command to navigate to it:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="version-control-git.html#cb4-1"></a><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="bu">cd</span> \</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This command stands for “change directory”. The “\” symbol indicates the root directory. On Mac/Linux, you can navigate to the root directory by simply typing “cd” or:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="version-control-git.html#cb5-1"></a><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="bu">cd</span> ~</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you want to go to a specific directory other than the root, you can type its path (relative to the folder you’re currently in) after “cd”. To go from Users\Simona to Users\Simona\Documents:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="version-control-git.html#cb6-1"></a><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="bu">cd</span> Documents</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you want to go back to the parent of the current directory (the folder that contains it), you can use:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb7-1"><a href="version-control-git.html#cb7-1"></a><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="bu">cd</span> ..</span></code></pre></div>
<p>To go back to Users from Documents:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb8-1"><a href="version-control-git.html#cb8-1"></a><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="bu">cd</span> ..\..</span></code></pre></div>
<p>To go back to Documents from Users:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb9-1"><a href="version-control-git.html#cb9-1"></a><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="bu">cd</span> Simona\Documents</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<div id="configuring-git" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Configuring Git</h2>
<p>Once Git is installed on our computer, we need to do a few one-time steps to configure it. Let’s set up our name and our email address by typing the following in the terminal:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb10-1"><a href="version-control-git.html#cb10-1"></a><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">git</span> config --global user.name <span class="st">&quot;First Last&quot;</span></span>
<span id="cb10-2"><a href="version-control-git.html#cb10-2"></a><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">git</span> config --global user.email <span class="st">&quot;first.last@example.com&quot;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This will be important when we start using GitHub. If you want to change these options in the future you always can, and if you want to use different options than the global ones within a specific project you can run the commands above removing “–global” while in the project directory (not the root!).</p>
<p>There are more configuration options you can personalize, but we won’t get into that in this workshop. If you want to check what configuration options you have active, you can use:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb11"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb11-1"><a href="version-control-git.html#cb11-1"></a><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">git</span> config --list</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<div id="getting-help" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.6</span> Getting help</h2>
<p>If you need help while using Git, you can use any of the following commands to get the manual page for any of the Git verbs:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb12"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb12-1"><a href="version-control-git.html#cb12-1"></a><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">git</span> help <span class="op">&lt;</span>verb<span class="op">&gt;</span></span>

<span id="cb12-3"><a href="version-control-git.html#cb12-3"></a><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">man</span> git-<span class="op">&lt;</span>verb<span class="op">&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<div id="creating-a-repository" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.7</span> Creating a repository</h2>
<p>Once Git is set up and configured, we are ready to create our first repository. A repository is a directory that is under version control. Let’s use the example directory structure from Figure <a href="version-control-git.html#fig:dir-example">2.3</a>. First, we navigate to the folder where we want to initialize our repository. In our example’s case, that is:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb13"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb13-1"><a href="version-control-git.html#cb13-1"></a><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="bu">cd</span> Documents\PhD\Research\GreenFrogs</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we will enable Git to start tracking everything inside this folder:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb14"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb14-1"><a href="version-control-git.html#cb14-1"></a><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">git</span> init</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This command initializes Git. It may appear like nothing changed, but if you allow the option to show hidden files in your file explorer you will notice there is a new subfolder called .git. That folder is where Git will store all of its version control information. You don’t have to worry about the content of that folder and you can keep using your files normally like you always would.</p>
</div>
<div id="tracking-files" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.8</span> Tracking files</h2>
<p>Creating a repository enables Git to start tracking files within it, but that does not happen automatically. We have to tell Git which files we want to track. We can check what Git is tracking so far by using:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb15"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb15-1"><a href="version-control-git.html#cb15-1"></a><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">git</span> status </span></code></pre></div>
<p>At the bottom, we’ll see a list of untracked files. We need to switch on tracking on those. To begin tracking a new file, we use the verb ‘add’. For example, to track a file named “green_frog_diet_data_cleaning.R” we would type:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb16"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb16-1"><a href="version-control-git.html#cb16-1"></a><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">git</span> add green_frog_diet_data_cleaning.R</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This works well if we want to add a specific file. If we want to start tracking the whole content of the folder, we can do:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb17"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb17-1"><a href="version-control-git.html#cb17-1"></a><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">git</span> add --all</span></code></pre></div>
<p>But be careful when using this command: Git is optimized to work with plain text files (for example .txt or R scripts), and it doesn’t really understand binary files (which is how Word files are stored, for example). Also, some files typically do not need to be version controlled, such as images; in fact, because they are large files, version controlling images can end up clogging your workflow. Make sure you are always aware of what exactly you’re adding when you use ‘git add –all’. When in doubt, add files one by one. There are also ways to make this process a little more distraction-proof: in the next step, we’ll see how to make sure we only track the files we want.</p>
</div>
<div id="ignoring-files" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.9</span> Ignoring files</h2>
<p>We can set up some rules to exclude from version control files that it would be superfluous or detrimental to track. Writing these down as rules can save us some time and headaches versus having to decide manually every time. We can exclude files from version control within a repository by using .gitignore. This is simply a text file that lists all the rules for files that, by default, we do not want to track. Rules can be based on the file type or patterns in the file name. Generally, there are a few criteria you can consider when deciding what to exclude from version control:</p>
<ul>
<li>File encoding (plain-text vs. binary): Git cannot track changes within binary files, so, even though you <strong>can</strong> store these files under version control, you won’t be able to use Git to compare different version, so there’s really no point in tracking these;</li>
<li>Code-generated: anything that can be reproduced by running code does not need to be version-controlled;</li>
<li>Size: files that are too big will slow down the functioning of Git. As a benchmark, you can keep in mind the maximum size limit enforced by GitHub, which is 100 MB – but if you follow the two criteria above, you will rarely end up with this problem because 100 MB’s worth of plain-text files is a whole lot of plain text.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can create a text file called “.gitignore” in our repository by using your default text editor (Notepad for Windows, TextEdit for MacOS, etc). The name must be exactly “.gitignore” for Git to recognize it. The file must have no extension (i.e., .txt) so go ahead and delete that (don’t worry about any warnings).</p>
<p>Once .gitignore is created, we can start adding rules. Nothing prevents us from listing files in .gitignore one by one, but this approach is not efficient:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>stacked_barplot_diet_composition.jpg<br />
predicted_population_trends.jpg<br />
individual_movement_tracks.jpg<br />
capture_locations.jpg<br />
green_frog_diet_manuscript.docx<br />
green_frog_movement_manuscript.docx<br />
green_frog_demography_manuscript.docx</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead, we can use pattern matching to kill many birds with one stone. What all these files have in common is they are all either .jpg’s or .docx’s. We can use the wildcard ’*’ to signify “any character” before the file extension:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*.jpg<br />
*.docx</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This will exclude any .jpg or .docx file from being tracked by Git in this repository. Since the images are conveniently located all together in one folder, we can also just do this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>figures/</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We should also add the following rules to ignore the user-specific R project files:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*.Rhistory<br />
/.Rproj.user/</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can add as many rules as we like, then save the .gitignore text file when we’re done. Now, if we didn’t forget to include anything that needed to be ignored, we can safely add all our files in one go:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb18"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb18-1"><a href="version-control-git.html#cb18-1"></a><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">git</span> add --all</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<div id="the-3-states" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.10</span> The 3 states</h2>
<p>Once files are tracked by Git, they can be in one of three states: modified, staged, or committed. A modified file includes edits that have not been recorded in Git yet; when we stage a modified file, we mark it as ready to be committed; when we commit that staged file, the current version gets stored in the history of that file.</p>
<p>Git works with snapshots called “commits”, which are records of what the repository looked like at a certain point in time. By committing a file, we freeze that version of the file forever in its history and we will be able to go back to it. Then, if we edit the file again, we’ll have to tell Git when we’re ready to make a new commit by moving that file to the staging area. Note that the same command <code>git add</code> is used both to start tracking a previously untracked file and to add a modified file to the staging area.</p>
<p>Now we are ready to do our first commit. We use the following command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb19"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb19-1"><a href="version-control-git.html#cb19-1"></a><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">git</span> commit -m <span class="st">&quot;First commit&quot;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Each commit should be accompanied by a message, added with the flag <code>-m</code>. The message should describe the changes made to the file/s since the previous commit. It is a good habit to write detailed commit messages, so that when we need to go back and recover a previous version of a file, we can read the history of commits and easily find the version we are looking for.</p>
</div>
<div id="un-staging-files" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.11</span> Un-staging files</h2>
<p>It happens to the best of us. We forgot to add a certain rule to .gitignore and when we go ahead and get ready to commit our files we realized we just staged a file we didn’t want to stage. No worries, there is a way to fix that. The following command un-stages files and saves us from having to commit them:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb20"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb20-1"><a href="version-control-git.html#cb20-1"></a><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">git</span> rm --cached filename</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can use pattern matching here as well, but you’ll need to put a backslash in front of the wildcard:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb21"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb21-1"><a href="version-control-git.html#cb21-1"></a><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">git</span> rm --cached <span class="dt">\*</span>.jpg</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<div id="recovering-a-previous-version-of-a-file" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.12</span> Recovering a previous version of a file</h2>
<p>Git works like a time machine, allowing us to recover any previous version of a tracked file. It does so by saving snapshots of what the file looked like at each commit. So, each commit represent a point in time that we can access to retrieve the version that existed at that time. We can take a look at the commit history using:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb22"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb22-1"><a href="version-control-git.html#cb22-1"></a><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">git</span> log</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here’s where current me will be grateful to past me for writing descriptive commit messages. If the commit messages do a good job of describing what changes I made to a file, it will be easy to recognize which commit is the one I want to go back to.</p>
<p>The string of numbers and letters following the word ‘commit’ in the log is called the hash and it uniquely identifies each commit. We can revert to the version of a file from a specific commit by using the hash as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb23"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb23-1"><a href="version-control-git.html#cb23-1"></a><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">git</span> checkout 9c5d9a3f52b7d43c1c0a06a94b11df5c3051ca27 -- filename.ext</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<div id="removing-git" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.13</span> Removing Git</h2>
<p>If for any reason you ever want to remove Git tracking from a repository (going back to a regular folder without version control) you can use the following command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb24"><pre class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb24-1"><a href="version-control-git.html#cb24-1"></a><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="fu">rm</span> -rf .git</span></code></pre></div>

<div id="git-everyday" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.14</span> Git everyday</h2>
<p>This chapter walked you through commands to configure git, initialize repositories, stage and un-stage files, commit changes, and revert to previous versions of a file. In practice, you may use some of these commands only once (e.g., to configure your email address when you first install Git) or when you start a new repository. In your everyday use of Git, the most important commands you need to remember are those to add and commit your changes. For everything else, feel free to refer back to this manual or other resources on the internet.</p>
